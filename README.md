# Next-Word-Prediction-Model

Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features; google also uses next word prediction based on our browsing history. So a preloaded data is also stored in the keyboard function of our smartphones to predict the next word correctly.I will train a Deep Learning model for next word prediction using Python. I will use the Tensorflow and Keras library in Python for next word prediction model.For making a Next Word Prediction model, I will train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
